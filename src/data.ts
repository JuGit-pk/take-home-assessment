Unlike traditional robo-advisors that confine you to a single custodian and a one-size-fits-all model portfolio, Surmount lets you deploy data-driven strategies—created by our team, by professional quants, or by yourself—across any supported broker. You keep control of your account, we handle the execution logic, and every trade remains fully transparent inside your existing brokerage portal",
